There are a few key differences you will notice when it comes to t the Angular project structure and the HTML customer facing page. When first looking at the two, you may notice the large difference in scale. The Angular project has a CSS, HTML and TS file for each component. If there are a lot of components on the page, this can become quite cumbersome to work with. That being said, there are also some key advantages to the structure. One of the biggest being the ability to reuse the components. With each component having itâ€™s separate module to be imported, we can simply reuse the code by importing the component in later versions. Java script is an actual programming language while JSON is simply a lightweight data interchange format. JSON is for the communication between a server and web application. There were multiple times that I refactored the HTML with a for loop to simplify and optimize my code. One example would be the listing of trips. Endpoints are URLs that direct the user to resources from the server API. I feel this course has helped me way more than any other course I have taken thus far. I now have a large projecct that I can add to my portfolio and even reference in my future projects.
